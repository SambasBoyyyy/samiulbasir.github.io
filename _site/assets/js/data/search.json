    "content": "In Flutter, widgets are the building blocks of your app’s UI. There are two types of widgets: Stateless and Stateful. While stateless widgets are immutable and cannot change their state after they are built, stateful widgets can change their state during their lifetime.What is a Stateful Widget?A stateful widget is a widget that has mutable state. This means that the widget can rebuild itself when its state changes. A stateful widget consists of two classes:  StatefulWidget: This class is immutable and can be considered as the configuration for the widget.  State: This is where the mutable state resides. The state object persists over the lifetime of the widget and is responsible for rebuilding the widget when the state changes.Creating a Stateful WidgetTo create a stateful widget in Flutter, you need to extend the StatefulWidget class and override the createState() method to return an instance of your State class.import 'package:flutter/material.dart';class MyStatefulWidget extends StatefulWidget {  @override  _MyStatefulWidgetState createState() =&gt; _MyStatefulWidgetState();}class _MyStatefulWidgetState extends State&lt;MyStatefulWidget&gt; {  int _counter = 0;  void _incrementCounter() {    setState(() {      _counter++;    });  }  @override  Widget build(BuildContext context) {    return Scaffold(      appBar: AppBar(        title: Text('Stateful Widget Example'),      ),      body: Center(        child: Column(          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,          children: &lt;Widget&gt;[            Text(              'You have pushed the button this many times:',            ),            Text(              '$_counter',              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,            ),          ],        ),      ),      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(        onPressed: _incrementCounter,        tooltip: 'Increment',        child: Icon(Icons.add),      ),    );  }}"
  }
